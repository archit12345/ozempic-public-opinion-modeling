# ozempic-public-opinion-modeling
In this project, I used ordinal logistic regression and partial proportional odds logistic regression to analyze public sentiment surrounding new GLP-1 weight loss medications like Ozempic, using data from the American Trends Survey Panel Wave 142 by the Pew Research Center. Data from the survey were released in February 2024. 

  The raw survey data is saved in this repository under ATP W142.csv. The codebook for the variable names is saved as ATP W142 Codebook.xlsx. 
  For more information on the methodology of the American Trends Panel survey see ATP Methodology.pdf
